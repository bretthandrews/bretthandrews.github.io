We place our method ([Dey et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211015209D/abstract)) for locally calibrating probability distribution functions (PDFs) on firm theoretical grounds.  We demonstrate its use on photometric redshift data and for time-dependent tropical cyclone data.
