Standard K-correction methods rely on SED templates, but these templates can be poorly constrained in some bands (e.g., WISE W4).  We present a data-driven method that for determining K-corrections even for bands that lack good templates.  Assuming that low redshift galaxies constitute a one-parameter family, if given just one rest-frame color (e.g., in bands that are well-constrained by SED templates), we can regress across a large sample of low redshift galaxies to determine K-corrections for bands ranging from GALEX FUV to WISE W4.
