The Milky Way's UV-to-IR SED cannot be directly determined due to dust extinction and our location within the Galaxy, so we use Gaussian Process Regression trained on the fluxes of external galaxies to estimate the Milky Way's UV-to-IR SED.  Previous studies have found that the Milky Way lies in the green valley in optical color-mass diagrams (in between the star-forming and quiescent regions), however, we find that the Milky way lies in the star-forming portion of UV and IR diagnostic diagrams.
