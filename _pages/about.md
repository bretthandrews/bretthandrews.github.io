I'm a research assistant professor in the [Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/) department at the University of Pittsburgh. I earned my Ph.D. in Astronomy from The Ohio State University and my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy from Yale University.

My current research focuses on estimating photometric redshifts of galaxies using neural networks (w/ Biprateep Dey and Jeff Newman) and constraining hard-to-determine properties of our own Galaxy by studying its extragalactic analogs (w/ Catherine Fielder and Jeff Newman).

I am a core developer of [Marvin](https://dr16.sdss.org/marvin/), a data access, exploration, analysis, and visualization toolkit for the [SDSS-IV MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/) survey (w/ Brian Cherinka, Jose Sanchez-Gallego, and Joel Brownstein).

My Ph.D. research explored the growth and evolution of galaxies as traced by changes in the abundance of chemical elements in their gas (w/ Paul Martini) and stars (w/ David Weinberg and Jennifer Johnson). I developed a code called [flexCE](https://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE) to make theoretical predictions for the chemical evolution of a galaxy over its lifetime.
