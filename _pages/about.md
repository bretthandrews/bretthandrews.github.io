I'm a research associate professor in the [Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/) department at the University of Pittsburgh. I earned my Ph.D. in Astronomy from [The Ohio State University](https://astronomy.osu.edu/) and my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy from [Yale University](https://astronomy.yale.edu/).

My current research focuses on:
- estimating photometric redshifts of galaxies using deep capsule networks and developing better uncertainty quantification methods (w/ [Biprateep Dey](https://biprateep.github.io/) and [Jeff Newman](https://janewman-pitt-edu.github.io/)),
- characterizing the relationship between galaxy photometry, emission lines, and photometric redshifts (w/ [Ashod Khederlarian](https://ashodkh.github.io), [Yoki Salcedo](https://yoquelbinsalcedo.github.io), and [Jeff Newman](https://janewman-pitt-edu.github.io/))
- constraining hard-to-determine properties of our own Milky Way (e.g., the UV-to-IR spectral energy distribution) by using statistical methods, such as Gaussian Process Regression, to leverage large samples of similar galaxy (w/ [Cat Fielder](https://cfielder.github.io/) and [Jeff Newman](https://janewman-pitt-edu.github.io/)), and
- measuring the mass-metallicity relation for massive galaxies at z ~ 0.8 with LEGA-C (w/ [Zach Lewis](https://zachjlewis.github.io/), Mariah Jones, Katie Mack, and [Rachel Bezanson](https://rachelbezanson.github.io/)).

I am a core developer of [Marvin](https://dr16.sdss.org/marvin/), a data access, exploration, analysis, and visualization toolkit for the [SDSS-IV MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/) survey (w/ Brian Cherinka, Jose Sanchez-Gallego, and Joel Brownstein).

My Ph.D. research explored the growth and evolution of galaxies as traced by changes in the abundance of chemical elements in their gas (w/ [Paul Martini](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/martini.10)) and stars (w/ [David Weinberg](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/weinberg.21) and [Jennifer Johnson](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/johnson.3064)). I developed a code called [flexCE](https://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE) to make theoretical predictions for the chemical evolution of a galaxy over its lifetime.
