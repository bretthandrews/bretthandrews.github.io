2011-02-01	Assessing Radiation Pressure as a Feedback Mechanism in Star-forming Galaxies	ApJ	Radiation pressure from the absorption and scattering of starlight by dust grains, which are hydrodynamically coupled to the gas, sets a hard upper limit to the luminosity of star-forming regions.	Andrews, B. H. & Thompson, T. A. 2011, ApJ, 727, 97.	rad-press	https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...727...97A
2012-09-01	Principal Component Abundance Analysis of Microlensed Bulge Dwarf and Subgiant Stars	AcA	PCA of elemental abundances of bulge stars revealing that the first two components are (1) correlated alpha elements and (2) correlated Na and Ni---two elements that have metallicity-dependent core-collapse supernova yields.	Andrews, B. H., et al. 2012, AcA, 62, 269.	pcaa-mbd	https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AcA....62..269A
2013-03-01	The Mass-Metallicity Relation with the Direct Method on Stacked Spectra of SDSS Galaxies	ApJ	The direct method mass-metallicity relation has a steeper slope, a lower turnover mass, and a factor of 2-3 greater dependence on SFR than strong line mass-metallicity relations.	Andrews, B. H. & Martini, P. 2013, ApJ, 765, 140.	andrews-martini	https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...765..140A
